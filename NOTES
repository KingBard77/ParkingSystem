Certainly, a parking system project in Symfony could include various features, but I'll assume that you want to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing parking spots, vehicles, and maybe even payments. Below is a table that outlines some of the entities (models), their attributes (fields), and the relationships between them.
Entities & Attributes
Entity
Attributes
Description
ParkingSpot
- ID<br/>- Name<br/>- Status (Available/Occupied)<br/>- Type (Car/Truck/Motorbike)
Represents a single parking spot within the parking facility.
Vehicle
- ID<br/>- License Plate<br/>- Type (Car/Truck/Motorbike)<br/>- Owner
Represents a vehicle parked in the parking facility.
Owner
- ID<br/>- Name<br/>- Contact Number<br/>- Email
Represents the owner of a vehicle.
Payment
- ID<br/>- Amount<br/>- Payment Method (Cash/Card)<br/>- Timestamp<br/>- ParkingSpot ID
Represents a payment made for using a parking spot.
Relationships
	•	Each ParkingSpot can have zero or one Vehicle.
	•	Each Vehicle belongs to one Owner.
	•	Each Payment is associated with a ParkingSpot.
CRUD Operations Overview
ParkingSpot
	•	Create: Add a new parking spot with a name, status, and type.
	•	Read: View the list of all parking spots and their statuses.
	•	Update: Change the status or type of a parking spot.
	•	Delete: Remove a parking spot from the system.
Vehicle
	•	Create: Register a new vehicle with a license plate, type, and owner.
	•	Read: View the list of all registered vehicles.
	•	Update: Update the license plate, type, or owner of a vehicle.
	•	Delete: Unregister a vehicle from the system.
Owner
	•	Create: Add a new owner with a name, contact number, and email.
	•	Read: View the list of all owners.
	•	Update: Update the name, contact number, or email of an owner.
	•	Delete: Remove an owner from the system.
Payment
	•	Create: Make a new payment with the amount, method, and parking spot.
	•	Read: View the list of all payments.
	•	Update: (Optional) Update the amount or method of a payment.
	•	Delete: (Optional) Delete a payment record.
By designing your Symfony project based on these entities, attributes, and CRUD operations, you can build a robust parking system application. You would typically use Doctrine to define these entities and relationships, and Symfony's controller and Twig templating system to handle the CRUD logic and presentation.

if standard = Rm120
else premium = Rm150
else = Rm180 

i want from type will popup on rate

so the total amount on table payment should be multiple by 30 which means 30 days 

My plan still now works where im target when choose parkingspot on payment view form can get know what the type and rate from parkingspot. after this in my amount it could be multiple 30 * rate from parkingspot.

please highlight only one option i should achieve, don't provide more than one option and not success any kind of option
